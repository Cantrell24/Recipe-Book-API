# Recipe Book Application

# Project Overview
In this project, we are developing a Recipe Book Application that displays a variety of recipes fetched from a free recipe API. Each time the page is refreshed, a new set of recipes with unique ingredients will be shown, providing users with fresh recipe ideas. The application requires an API key to access the recipe API, which is necessary for fetching recipe data.

# Features
Dynamic Recipe Display: On each page refresh, a new set of recipes is displayed.
Varied Ingredients: Recipes come with distinct ingredients each time.
Recipe Links: Direct links are provided to access the full recipe details on the recipe website.

# Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the web page.
CSS: For styling and layout of the application.
JavaScript: For fetching data from the API and dynamically updating the content.
Recipe API: A free recipe API to retrieve recipe data.
